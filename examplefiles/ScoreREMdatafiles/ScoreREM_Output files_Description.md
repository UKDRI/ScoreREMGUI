#### File list and overview : Total 10 files
1. "SN001_scoredREMlabels_2024-06-14T121927.mat":
    Scored annotations with the time and date of scoring. Contains the annotations/labels in the format used by ScoreREM. The user can use the file to reload (using reload button) the labels and start from the location they left off; 
2. "SN001_ScoreREMOutput.xlsx":
    Total 6 sheets, 
    "Hypnogram" - Contains the hypnogram and label definition;
    "Unmodified Hypnogram" - Contains the hypnogram, Unmodified hypnogram and label definition;
    "Summary" - Contains the sleep summary measures with Phasic and Tonic measures as well. The estimates are between the recording start and end while its computed over the lights off period if a Marker file is used; 
    "EOG-L-NUM"	"EOG-R-NUM" - Annotated labels in numerical format;	
    "EOG-L-STR"	"EOG-R-STR" - Annotated labels in string format; 
4. "SN001_ScoreREM_FullPSD_EEG C3-M2.xlsx"; "SN001_ScoreREM_FullPSD_EEG C4-M1.xlsx"; "SN001_ScoreREM_FullPSD_EEG F4-M1.xlsx"; "SN001_ScoreREM_FullPSD_EEG O2-M1.xlsx":
    Contains the epoch wise Power spectral density of artefact free microepochs. The micro epochs are averaged over an epoch excluding the ones scored as Artefacts; 
5. "SN001_ScoreREM_REMPSD_EEG C3-M2.xlsx"; "SN001_ScoreREM_REMPSD_EEG C4-M1.xlsx"; "SN001_ScoreREM_REMPSD_EEG F4-M1.xlsx"; "SN001_ScoreREM_REMPSD_EEG O2-M1.xlsx":
    Contains the epoch wise Power spectral density of Tonic, Phasic and Artefact microepochs. The Tonic, Phasic and Artefact micro epochs are averaged over an epoch.
